This is a Calculator made for the 100Devs Homework called:

# ðŸ”¢ #100Devs Push Project001: Calculator

### Goal: Build a Simple Calculator using JS OOP best practices

The Calculator file consists of 3 main files,

* index.html --> consists of html code
* styles.css --> all the styling
* app.js -->JavaScript code for the interactions and calculations.

When i made this calculator i didnt know the code for the calculations so i had to utilise code from a tutorial tweak it a little =)

Hope you'll like it!
